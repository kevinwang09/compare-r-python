# Why I am making this site?

1. There are pros and cons of both languages. Knowing which tasks can be performed well in one language can help me to choose the right tools when needed. 
1. I am learning `python`, and I need a repository of codes for reference to perform tasks that I already know well in `R`.
1. This is a place for me to document my self-learning during COVID-19. Hopefully this will be a good place to point to when I seek future employments.

# Structure

The rest of this site is organised into webpages at the top, with each webpage correspond to a specific task. Each webpage is organised into two columns, with `R` codes on the left and the `python` codes on the right, aiming to achieve the same tasks. 

# Code reproducibility

![rmarkdown-build](https://github.com/kevinwang09/compare-r-python/workflows/rmarkdown-build/badge.svg)

This website is deployed through GitHub Actions using [this workflow](https://github.com/kevinwang09/compare-r-python/blob/main/.github/workflows/rmarkdown-build.yaml). As such, the codes should be fully reproducible. The Python modules are also encapsulated in a virtual environment as specified in the workflow file.
